## Introduction

we live in dark ages of software

comparison
  library = computer
  book = app/library/service
  text = software
  monks = developers
  sermon = user interface
  church = big corporates (Facebook, Amazon, Google And Apple)
  
central claim:
  In order to enable Software Literacy, we need to drastically reduce the cost of creating software. This includes cost for hardware and training with training being the dominant factor. Not everybody needs to become a professional writer, but everybody should be able to express their own ideas in software and understand, use, change and combine ideas expressed by others. Literacy is not simply reading and writing, but being able to understand and formulate mental models.


## Complications

Example: Mary own a coffee shop and wants to find out if she can increase the shop's throughput by hiring more staff or buying more machines. She finds an open source simulation which she has to adapt to fit her situation.

- segregation - running is double-click, but how to edit
- set-up
- dependencies
- syntax
- difficulty of "reading" software - understanding the simulation's model
- undiscoverable interfaces
- losing context between restarts
- not being able to access other languages
- serialization - saving simulation data
- interpretation - making sense of the data
- data safety - code and data
- difficulty of sharing
- lack of security - customer data stolen by some minor dependency
- lack of autonomy - Facebook page suspended because of mix-up


## Motivation

- understand what systems around you do
- improve thinking skills by explicitly describing mental models (thinking about thinking)
- learning and arguing by running experiments and simulations
- collaboration by externalizing mental models
- empowerment by solving your own problems


## Pitch

Claim: There are platforms that solve some of these complications quite well but none that avoids all of them.

The goal of zells is to create a software platform that avoids all of these complications and therefore enable software literacy

augment human intellect - Doug Engelbart

Reducing the cost of software includes cost for hardware and training with training being the dominant factor. Not everybody needs to become a professional writer, but everybody should be able to express their own ideas in software and understand, use, change and combine ideas expressed by others.

I love... computers, software and science
I believe... that software literacy can bring a new enlightenment
I am committed to... working on decreasing the cost of becoming fluent in the dynamic medium to enable a general software literacy
