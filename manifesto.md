# Enabling Software Literacy

Computers are amazing. They let us connect with people on the other side of the globe, access endless streams of entertainment, be super heroes, discover new truths about our universe, and bring a million other wonders that would have been considered magic a four generations ago. And yet, we still live in the Dark Ages of computing.

## A New Medium

Hundreds of years ago, before the Age of Enlightenment, producing texts was incredibly expensive. They had to be written on rare paper, and bundled up into bulky and fragile books. They could only be written by well trained professionals, were usually big and complicated, and therefore took a long time to write. Only the largest and wealthiest institutions could afford to create them, and controlled which texts were written and which were not. With a very small number of books, and reading being considered difficult to learn, people instead listened to their interpretations at weekly gatherings. It was free, easy and convenient.

Few people could imagine a world of general literacy where text is virtually everywhere and almost everybody can access and contribute to the corpus of collective human knowledge. It required the invention of the printing press to make text production cheap enough to start an upward spiral of printed books and literate citizens, which ultimately lead to the Scientific Revolution.

Four millennia after the first written word marked the beginning of history, the invention of the computer gave us a new medium, one of executable dynamic models - called software. Its potential to augment the human intellect was already described 50 years ago, still almost nobody is literate, let alone fluent in it.

Instead of learning to express our own ideas, and understand those of others enough to change and reproduce them, we are content with the interpretations and options that user interfaces give us, making their designers our priests, their companies our churches, and their developers our monks.

In order to enable a general Software Literacy, we need to drastically reduce the cost of producing software by making it orders of magnitude easier to write, read, change and share it. The goal is not to make everyone professional developers, but to enable every person to express their own ideas and access powerful ideas of others that could not be expressed in any other medium.


## Accidental Complications



------------------- Outline ----------------------

## Introduction

we live in dark ages of software

comparison
  library = computer
  book = app/library/service
  text = software
  monks = developers
  sermon = user interface
  church = big corporates (Facebook, Amazon, Google And Apple)
  
central claim:
  In order to enable Software Literacy, we need to drastically reduce the cost of creating software. This includes cost for hardware and training with training being the dominant factor. Not everybody needs to become a professional writer, but everybody should be able to express their own ideas in software and understand, use, change and combine ideas expressed by others. Literacy is not simply reading and writing, but being able to understand and formulate mental models.


## Complications

Example: Mary own a coffee shop and wants to find out if she can increase the shop's throughput by hiring more staff or buying more machines. She finds an open source simulation which she has to adapt to fit her situation.

- segregation - running is double-click, but how to edit
- set-up
- dependencies
- syntax
- difficulty of "reading" software - understanding the simulation's model
- undiscoverable interfaces
- losing context between restarts
- not being able to access other languages
- serialization - saving simulation data
- data safety - code and data
- difficulty of sharing
- lack of security - customer data stolen by some minor dependency
- lack of autonomy - Facebook page suspended because of mix-up


## Motivation

- understand what systems around you do
- improve thinking skills by explicitly describing mental models (thinking about thinking)
- learning and arguing by running experiments and simulations
- collaboration by externalizing mental models
- empowerment by solving your own problems


## Pitch

Claim: There are platforms that solve some of these complications quite well but none that avoids all of them.

The goal of zells is to create a software platform that avoids all of these complications and therefore enable software literacy


------------ Notes -------------

augment human intellect - Doug Engelbart

Reducing the cost of software includes cost for hardware and training with training being the dominant factor. Not everybody needs to become a professional writer, but everybody should be able to express their own ideas in software and understand, use, change and combine ideas expressed by others.

I love... computers, software and science
I believe... that software literacy can bring a new enlightenment
I am committed to... working on decreasing the cost of becoming fluent in the dynamic medium to enable a general software literacy
