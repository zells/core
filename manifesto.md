# Enabling Software Literacy

[introduction / summary + hook]


## Dark Ages

[what is the problem?]

- producing software is expensive, like texts were
- controlled by small elite
- data silos?
- spread of data without source?
- maybe exactly define how software relates to text in terms of the analogy
  -> explain the analogy here

During the Dark Ages, producing texts was very expensive. It required highly trained experts to write and bind books. Therefore only very few people could read, the majority was content with the interpretations served at weekly gatherings. Only the wealthy could afford to produce books and controlled which ones were written, which ideas were spread.

Same today. Software is text. Writing it is programming, creating and debugging executable dynamic models. GUIs only give interpreted access to a small controlled fraction to it, they are the priests. Reading is accessing and understanding the underlying models. A computer is pen, paper and reading glasses. A book is a cohesive model. The Internet is a library. Programmers are the monks. The tech giants are the churches.

Stakes today are even higher. It's not just our thoughts that are controlled but our identities, relationships, and freedom of expression. Software is not just a dead/static expression of an idea, but a living/dynamic one. Much more powerful, because no brain is needed to interpret the idea. It can interpret itself, calculate implications itself. Example?


## Enlightenment

[why is this problem important?]

- text literacy led to the scientific revolution and the age of enlightenment
- all the good software can do
- software literacy could lead to the next scientific revolution
- understanding, learning, collaboration, empowerment, meta-cognition

The scientific revolution ended the dark ages and started the Age of Enlightenment. Positive feedback loop of literate people and new published ideas. Euclid's Elements was the "killer application", second only to the Bible. Reading lead to new ideas written into new books lead to more reasons to become literate which again lead to more ideas.

Understanding the virtual world like Physics, Chemistry and Biology help understanding the physical world. Faster learning through cheaper and otherwise impossible experiments. Improved meta-cognition by externalizing mental models. Easier collaboration by sharing these models. Empowerment by solving one's own problems.


## Cost

[why is this problem difficult?]

- total cost: brain to brain
- essential and accidental complexity
- managing essential complexity focus of most
- accidental complexity is main source in small projects
- segregation, set-up, dependencies, syntax, comprehensibility, volatile state, invisible state, static documentation, language silos, serialization, interpretation, fragile data, sharing, security, autonomy

How much does it cost to get this idea from your brain into other brains? Text: very cheap since for literate people. Software: very expensive even for literate people, incredibly expensive for illiterate people.

Cost factors: training, essential complexity, accidental complexity. With low essential complexity, only training and accidental complexity.


## Printing Press

[how can this problem be solved?]

- avoiding accidental complication
- would not make complex problems easy
- but easier to get started with simple problems
- more accessible for everyone

Avoid accidental complexity. Make simple thing incredibly simple. Would also help essential complexity. Reduce cost -> more software -> more literacy -> more software.

# zells - Enabling Software Literacy

Computers are amazing. They let us connect with friends on the other side of the globe, access endless streams of entertainment, be super heroes, discover new truths about our universe, and bring a million other wonders that would have been considered pure magic a couple of generations ago. And yet, in spite of these achievements, we still live in the Dark Ages of computing.

To unleash the full power of computers, we need to increase the number of software literate people - people who can write and read software, not just use it. [todo: refine this sentence] The goal is a universal software literacy, similar to the levels of text literacy we have nowadays. And just like most people aren't professional authors, the goal is not for everybody to be professional software developers, but to enable every person with access to a computer to express their own ideas, as well as understand and build upon powerful ideas of others through the medium of software.

[todo: define "Software"]
 - software =/= apps
 - executable dymaic model

**The mission of *zells* is to work towards Universal Software Literacy by drastically decreasing the cost of writing, reading, changing, and sharing dynamic models.**


## Software as a Medium

Hundreds of years ago, before the Age of Enlightenment, producing texts was incredibly expensive. They had to be written on rare paper and bundled up into bulky and fragile books. They could only be written by well trained professionals, were usually big and complicated, and therefore took a long time to write. Only the largest and wealthiest institutions could afford to create them, and controlled which texts were written and which were not. With a tiny number of books around and reading being considered difficult to learn, people instead listened to their interpretations at weekly gatherings. It was free, easy and convenient.

Few people could imagine a world of universal literacy where text is virtually everywhere and almost everybody can access and contribute to an ever growing corpus of collective human knowledge. It wasn't until the invention of the printing press that text production became cheap enough to start an upward spiral of printed books and literate citizens, which ultimately lead to the Scientific Revolution.

Four millennia after the first written word marked the beginning of history, the invention of the computer gave us a new medium, one of executable dynamic models - called software. It lets us express ideas not only statically - being identical for every reader - but also dynamically - reacting to a changing world and interacting with its users. The potential of this new medium to augment the human intellect was already described 50 years ago [todo: add foot note to Licklider and Engelbart], yet almost nobody is literate [todo: find out numbers], let alone fluent in it.

Instead of learning to express our own ideas, and understand those of others enough to change and reproduce them, we are content with the limited interpretations and options that user interfaces give us, making their designers our priests, their companies our churches, and their developers our monks. To enable Software Literacy, we need a printing press [todo: not literally but metaphorically] for software. A way to make software cheap enough to start a spiral of accessible dynamic models and software literate citizens, which could lead to the next cognitive revolution [todo: refer to Scientific Revolution as first cognitive revolution].


## The Cost of Software

[todo: define "accidental complications"]
[todo: define cost in terms of "total cost of brain to brain"]

To make software cheaper, we need to understand what it is that makes it expensive. The hardware necessary to run it is definitely a factor, but a rapidly decreasing one. Also, a single computer is enough to access the entire library of all existing software, so the contribution of hardware cost to each individual piece is tiny.

Software is expensive because software developers are expensive. And developers are expensive, because it requires years of training to become a good one. The reason that you can get many programs for the equivalent of a cup of coffee or even for free, is that it's almost free to copy software. So every user only has to contribute a tiny fraction to its total cost. But the cost is always enormous, even if only consisting of volunteered evenings.

Why is this extensive training necessary? Because many software projects are big and complex. It's all but simple to build something that works, is fast, reliable, and solves an actual problem for thousands if not millions of people. Complex problems require complex solutions, which causes the majority of complications that make these projects expensive. These are essential complications.

But what about simple problems? Maybe you just want to write a little app that helps you with organizing your household chores. It only has to work somewhat, doesn't has to be very fast or reliable and only has to solve your own problem. Why is that still difficult to write? This is because of accidental complications.

Writing a novel or reading a scientific paper is hard, because of essential complications inherent in the task itself. It takes years of practice to become a good novelist or scientist. But writing a letter to your mother is easy. All you need is a pen and paper. If you would have to make your own paper from trees and your own pen from goose feathers, that would be accidental complications, because if would only keep you from writing that letter.


## Advantages of Software Literacy

[todo: reformulate to fit rest of document. Maybe scratch?]

But even though devastated by her struggles with the numerous accidental complications of software development, Mary kept at her simulation project and eventually got it working securely and robustly.

In the end she is glad to be software literate, since it helps her with **understanding** all the physical and virtual things around her. Before, things like her cash register, ATMs or most apps on her phone were black boxes to her. Now she understands how they work, why if not, and what risks are involved when using them. The world seems a little less magical, but she enjoys the feeling that, if she wanted to, she could probably learn to build and control any of these things.

When putting an idea of herself into software, Mary also notices that she spends a lot of time thinking about her own thoughts and often times she only really understood a concept after expressing it on software. This **thinking about thinking** eventually became second nature and not only helped her with her business, but also with personal problems.

She also enjoys using software like the simulation for **learning** new things about her business by experimenting with different scenarios and seeing how things change.

Software literacy lets her use a more **scientific** approach to running her shop. Instead of gut feelings and anecdotes, she is able to support her decisions with data collected from simulations. Instinctively, she wouldn't have taken the risk of hiring a new staff member, but the data show that this will increase throughput more economically than a new machine.

And once she had expressed an idea in software, she enjoys how easy it is to improve it by **collaborating** with her peers. After she made the simulation safe to run, Joe added some of his knowledge about coffee brewing so now it's even more accurate.

But the one thing she likes the best about being software literate is how **empowering** it is. She can create her own simulations, set-up her own website and booking system and solve her own problems. She would never want to give that up.


## Software without Complications

[todo: reformulate to fit rest of document]

The vision of *zells* is a world in which people like Mary are able to take advantage of the full power of software, without having to struggle through accidental complications. A world where you can easily write, read, share and collaborate on ideas using dynamic models instead of static artifacts, without constantly having to solve problems that are not essential to your goal.

Although for every mentioned complication there exists already at least one software platform that successfully avoids it, in order to make software sufficiently inexpensive to enable Software Literacy, we need a platform that avoids all accidental complications without decreasing its usefulness or usability.

Writing software should be as easy as picking up a pen and paper. Reading it should be as easy as opening a book. Sharing dynamic models should be as easy as showing a drawing to a friend. And shaping an idea together should be as easy as molding clay. This is the goal of [zells](http://zells.org).
